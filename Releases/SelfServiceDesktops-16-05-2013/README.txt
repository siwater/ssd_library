This is a distribution of the Citrix SelfService Desktops solution.

Read the Self Service Desktops Installation.docx - this is your installation guide

There is a folder named "Reference" which contains items of historical interest - you should not need them to install the solution. If you do need to use them, please e-mail simon.waterhouse@citrix.com so I can update the Install Guide if necessary,

Christian Ferber.

LAfferty for use before the WebApp installer (Setup) was written.
